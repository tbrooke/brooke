             <h3>Some tailored estate plans may include:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Drafting last wills and testaments and trusts for minor children</li>
	<li>Preparing living wills, health care powers of attorney and other advance directives</li>
	<li>Planning for asset management and preservation through the use of powers of attorney or a living trust</li>
</ul>
<p>
Brooke and Brooke makes it possible for clients to maintain control over their health care and financial affairs for as long as possible by planning in advance of disability. This is done through health care instruments such as powers of attorney, living wills and other health care directives. By preparing these documents, clients are able to let their desires be known and to name an agent to act on their behalf and carry out their desires if they are unable to do so themselves. These planning procedures can spare loved ones much hardship and stress during an already difficult time.
</p>
<h4>
Administration & Wills
</h4>
<p>
    An estate plan is only effective if it is properly administered. Carole Brooke assists individuals that have lost a loved one in matters of probate, estate, and trust administration. If your loved one had a Will, the family will go through a process called probate. If your loved one had a Trust, the family will go through a process called trust administration. Carole Brooke can guide executors, administrators, guardians, trustees and beneficiaries throughout the entire estate administration and settlement process, by:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Initiating probate proceedings with the proper authority</li>
	<li>Collecting the needed information to prepare income and estate tax returns</li> 
	<li>Advising on the accounting and tax treatment, and valuing the estate assets</li>
	<li>Choosing the most beneficial tax elections, deductions and estate payment vehicles</li>
	<li>Ensuring payment of claims, expenses and taxes</li>
	<li>Proper disposition and distribution of the estate assets</li>
</ul>
<p>
If your family has experienced the loss of a family member, our legal team at Brooke and Brooke can assist with legal matters to save you time and prevent losses or missteps from being made in order to preserve the wishes of the deceased and to spare loved ones additional stress during an already difficult period.
